    "9": "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.",
    "10": "Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.",
    "11": "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently.",
    "12": "Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.",
    "13": "At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure. And the sooner you realize that, you accept that, and integrate that into your work ethic, you will start being successful. As long as you blame others for the reason you aren't where you want to be, you will always be a failure.",
    "14": "I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can't accept not trying.",
    "15": "It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.",
    "16": "Success is not a good teacher, failure makes you humble.",
    "17": "It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default.",
    "18": "Honesty is the fastest way to prevent a mistake from turning into a failure.",
    "19": "Your attitude towards failure determines your altitude after failure.",
    "20": "Leadership is solving problems. The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help or concluded you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership.",
    "21": "There is no innovation and creativity without failure. Period.",
    "22": "My great concern is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with your failure.",
    "23": "My motto is more, 'If you want to find something new, look for something new!' There is a certain amount of risk in this attitude, as even the slightest failure tends to be resounding, but you are so happy when you succeed that it is worth taking the risk.",
    "24": "Being human means you will make mistakes. And you will make mistakes, because failure is God's way of moving you in another direction.",
    "25": "Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement. One fails forward toward success.",
    "26": "Failure is the key to success; each mistake teaches us something.",
    "27": "When we tackle obstacles, we find hidden reserves of courage and resilience we did not know we had. And it is only when we are faced with failure do we realise that these resources were always there within us. We only need to find them and move on with our lives.",
    "28": "True leaders don't invest in buildings. Jesus never built a building. They invest in people. Why? Because success without a successor is failure. So your legacy should not be in buildings, programs, or projects; your legacy must be in people.",
    "29": "Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.",

    "33": "A man can fail many times, but he isn't a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.",
    "34": "Your personal life, your professional life, and your creative life are all intertwined. I went through a few very difficult years where I felt like a failure. But it was actually really important for me to go through that. Struggle, for me, is the most inspirational thing in the world at the end of the day - as long as you treat it that way.",
    "35": "A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.",

    "37": "They talk about the failure of socialism but where is the success of capitalism in Africa, Asia and Latin America?",
    "38": "I'm not going to get somewhere and say, 'OK, I'm done.' Success is never final; I'll just keep on going. The same way as failure never being fatal. Just keep going. I'm going to the stars and then past them.",

    "40": "Do not fear mistakes. You will know failure. Continue to reach out.",
    "41": "Remember your dreams and fight for them. You must know what you want from life. There is just one thing that makes your dream become impossible: the fear of failure.",

    "50": "Without failure there is no achievement.",
    "51": "We all learn lessons in life. Some stick, some don't. I have always learned more from rejection and failure than from acceptance and success.",
    "52": "Part of being a man is learning to take responsibility for your successes and for your failures. You can't go blaming others or being jealous. Seeing somebody else's success as your failure is a cancerous way to live.",
    "53": "You have to be able to accept failure to get better.",
    "54": "The tragedy of life is often not in our failure, but rather in our complacency; not in our doing too much, but rather in our doing too little; not in our living above our ability, but rather in our living below our capacities.",
    "55": "Failure is not fatal, but failure to change might be.",
    "56": "Failure is a great teacher, and I think when you make mistakes and you recover from them and you treat them as valuable learning experiences, then you've got something to share.",
    "57": "You must accept that you might fail; then, if you do your best and still don't win, at least you can be satisfied that you've tried. If you don't accept failure as a possibility, you don't set high goals, you don't branch out, you don't try - you don't take the risk.",

    "60": "Develop success from failures. Discouragement and failure are two of the surest stepping stones to success.",

    "63": "Success is not the absence of failure; it's the persistence through failure.",
    "64": "I've probably earned the right to screw up a few times. I don't want the fear of failure to stop me from doing what I really care about.",
    "65": "Tragedy in life normally comes with betrayal and compromise, and trading on your integrity and not having dignity in life. That's really where failure comes.",
    "66": "Our failure as a society to properly acknowledge and confront the psychological, social, and political effects of white privilege has perpetuated racial inequality and race-based political resentments.",
    "67": "All human actions are equivalent and all are on principle doomed to failure.",
    "68": "Even when you have doubts, take that step. Take chances. Mistakes are never a failure - they can be turned into wisdom.",
    "69": "There is a huge difference between failing and failure. Failing is trying something that you learn doesn't work. Failure is throwing in the towel and giving up. True success comes from failing repeatedly and as quickly as possible, before your cash or your willpower runs out.",

    "73": "Failure is unimportant. It takes courage to make a fool of yourself.",
    "74": "Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don't fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day.",
    "75": "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.",
    "76": "The will to persevere is often the difference between failure and success.",
    "77": "Many of the familiar little things that we use every day have typically evolved over a period of time to a state of familiarity. They balance form and function, elegance and economy, success and failure in ways that are not only acceptable, but also admirable.",

    "79": "There is but one cause of human failure. And that is man's lack of faith in his true Self.",
    "80": "If those committed to the quest fail, they will be forgiven. When lost, they will find another way. The moral imperative of humanism is the endeavor alone, whether successful or not, provided the effort is honorable and failure memorable.",

    "83": "Suffering, failure, loneliness, sorrow, discouragement, and death will be part of your journey, but the Kingdom of God will conquer all these horrors. No evil can resist grace forever.",
    "84": "I believe in trusting men, not only once but twice - in giving a failure another chance.",
    "85": "But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.",
    "86": "We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse.",
    "87": "Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Failure is something we can avoid only by saying nothing, doing nothing, and being nothing.",
    "88": "Failure happens all the time. It happens every day in practice. What makes you better is how you react to it.",
    "89": "In the business world today, failure is apparently not an option. We need to change this attitude toward failure - and celebrate the idea that only by falling on our collective business faces do we learn enough to succeed down the road.",
    "90": "We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery.",
    "91": "If Liberia has failed, then, it is no evidence of the failure of the Negro in government. It is merely evidence of the failure of slavery.",
    "92": "It was an interesting question as to whether the BBC had a future in the digital world, and what form of market failure could justify the licence fee system.",
    "93": "Sometimes the best lighting of all is a power failure.",
    "94": "Every book I've written has been a different attempt to understand something, and the success or failure of the previous one is irrelevant. I write the book I want.",
    "95": "Case studies of failure should be made a part of the vocabulary of every engineer so that he or she can recall or recite them when something in a new design or design process is suggestive of what went wrong in the case study.",
    "96": "I looked long and carefully at the picture of a stag painted by Landseer - the style was good, and the brush was handled with fine effect; but he fails in copying Nature, without which the best work will be a failure.",
    "97": "When you learn to keep fighting in the face of potential failure, it gives you a larger skill set to do what you want to do in life. It gives you vision. But you can't acquire it if you're afraid of keeping score.",
    "98": "No matter how well things are going, failure and disaster are just around the corner. So celebrate the good, but be ready for the bad.",
    "99": "Ambition is the last refuge of the failure.",
    "100": "The surest way to fail is not to determine to succeed.",
    "101": "If you're not failing every now and again, it's a sign you're not doing anything very innovative.",
    "102": "Achievement is not always success, while reputed failure often is. It is honest endeavor, persistent effort to do the best possible under any and all circumstances.",
    "103": "The way most people fail is in not keeping up the heart.",
    "104": "Taxation is the price we pay for failing to build a civilized society. The higher the tax level, the greater the failure. A centrally planned totalitarian state represents a complete defeat for the civilized world, while a totally voluntary society represents its ultimate success.",
    "105": "There's always failure. And there's always disappointment. And there's always loss. But the secret is learning from the loss, and realizing that none of those holes are vacuums.",
    "106": "Inability to make decisions is one of the principal reasons executives fail. Deficiency in decision-making ranks much higher than lack of specific knowledge or technical know-how as an indicator of leadership failure.",
    "107": "Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.",
    "108": "I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it.",
    "109": "We do not realise that we are children of eternity. If we did, then success would be no success, and failure would be no failure to us.",
    "110": "The failure in Ohio to have adequate voting capacity for the people who were registered and eligible to vote was an absolute denial of their right to vote.",
    "111": "The assertion of failure coming from such persons does not mean that Mr. Mill failed to promote the practical success of those objects the advocacy of which forms the chief feature of his political writings.",
    "112": "There was a failure to recognize the deep problems in AI; for instance, those captured in Blocks World. The people building physical robots learned nothing.",
    "113": "If you try to do your best there is no failure.",
    "114": "I've had great success and I've had catastrophic failure. It's really how you handle the rough stuff that defines you, I think.",
    "115": "Failure's a natural part of life.",
    "116": "So long as TARP money is wrapped up in GM, the company will never shake its 'Government Motors' image. That label, as competitors and GM employees are keenly aware, is code for one thing: 'GM is a failure.'",
    "117": "Most leadership strategies are doomed to failure from the outset. As people have been noting for years, the majority of strategic initiatives that are driven from the top are marginally effective - at best.",
    "118": "I felt a failure because I couldn't sustain myself from what I earned from my writing. My day jobs were what mattered, and it was hard to even get those because universities wouldn't hire me as a real writer.",
    "119": "When we set up our kids for failure, we set up our workforce for failure, and we set up our economy for failure. I can't emphasize enough the importance, the absolute importance, of education in achieving long-term economic growth.",
    "120": "I've become a professional failure - in order to pay the mortgage I have to remain unemployed. Luckily, a disaster always seems to befall me at exactly the right moment.",
    "121": "For every failure, there's an alternative course of action. You just have to find it. When you come to a roadblock, take a detour.",
    "122": "We failed, but in the good providence of God apparent failure often proves a blessing.",
    "123": "We may be personally defeated, but our principles never!",
    "124": "The season of failure is the best time for sowing the seeds of success.",
    "125": "Remember the two benefits of failure. First, if you do fail, you learn what doesn't work; and second, the failure gives you the opportunity to try a new approach.",
    "126": "There are no mistakes, save one: the failure to learn from a mistake.",
    "127": "Failure is instructive. The person who really thinks learns quite as much from his failures as from his successes.",
    "128": "Failure to accord credit to anyone for what he may have done is a great weakness in any man.",
    "129": "The threat posed by Bank of America isn't just financial - it's a full-blown assault on the American dream. Where's the incentive to play fair and do well, when what we see rewarded at the highest levels of society is failure, stupidity, incompetence and meanness? If this is what winning in our system looks like, who doesn't want to be a loser?",
    "130": "You can be discouraged by failure, or you can learn from it. So go ahead and make mistakes, make all you can. Because, remember that's where you'll find success - on the far side of failure.",
    "131": "There are only really a few stories to tell in the end, and betrayal and the failure of love is one of those good stories to tell.",

    "136": "The failure to dissect the cause of war leaves us open for the next installment.",
    "137": "I have a lack of fear, whereas in the past the fear of failure was a powerful motivator. Anyway, I have great expectations for the future, but I just don't know if I'm the monarch of all I survey.",
    "138": "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I, therefore, intend to oppose the effort to increase America's debt.",
    "139": "If you have a level of expectation in your life that you have to be a quote-unquote star, whatever that means, you might be setting yourself up for failure.",
    "140": "I hate how box-office failures are blamed on an actress, yet I don't see a box-office failure blamed on men.",
    "141": "Most social acts have to be understood in their setting and lose meaning if isolated... No error in thinking about social facts is more serious than the failure to see their place and function.",
    "142": "In Arab capitals, the failure of the United States to stop Iran's nuclear program is understood as American weakness in the struggle for dominance in the Middle East, making additional cooperation from Arab leaders on Israeli-Palestinian issues even less likely.",
    "143": "Solyndra's failure isn't a reason for the government to give up on alternative energy, any more than the failure of Pets.com during the Internet bubble means that venture capital should steer clear of tech projects.",

    "146": "You make mistakes. Mistakes don't make you.",
    "147": "Before success comes in any man's life, he's sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That's exactly what the majority of men do.",
    "148": "Failure is a word unknown to me.",
    "149": "Once you can accept failure, you can have fun and success.",
    "150": "My father was a dreamer - my hero. He was a smart, tough guy from Poland, a cutter of lady's handbags, an old socialist-unionist who always considered himself a failure. His big line was: 'Don't end up like me.'",
    "151": "If we don't succeed we run the risk of failure.",
    "152": "If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success.",
    "153": "I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure - which is: Try to please everybody.",
    "154": "Successful people have a bigger fear of failure than people who've never done anything because if you haven't been successful, then you don't know how it feels to lose it all.",
    "155": "If something's important enough, you should try. Even if you - the probable outcome is failure.",
    "156": "Jobs for every American is doomed to failure because of modern automation and production. We ought to recognize it and create an income-maintenance system so every single American has the dignity and the wherewithal for shelter, basic food, and medical care. I'm talking about welfare for all. Without it, you're going to have warfare for all.",
    "157": "Love is such a powerful subject matter because it comes in so many different shapes and sizes. It's about timing, fate, failure, redemption.",

    "159": "Performers should really go to the best schools, like Lady Gaga, you know, she went to NYU and had great teachers... It's best to really study your technique as much as you possibly can so you can have a long career instead of a quick one that's a failure.",
    "160": "The failure of Lehman Brothers demonstrated that liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve would not be sufficient to stop the crisis; substantial fiscal resources were necessary.",

    "167": "Women, like men, should try to do the impossible. And when they fail, their failure should be a challenge to others.",
    "168": "Escapism, we are led to believe, is evidence of a deficiency in character, a certain failure of temperament, and like so many -isms, it is to be strenuously avoided. 'How do you expect to get ahead?,' people ask. But the question altogether misses the point. The escapist doesn't want to get ahead. He simply wants to get away.",
    "169": "Growing up, I had the weird fantasy list: I wanted to be Alice Cooper, Steven Spielberg, and Stan Lee. You have to have almost psychotic drive, because you're going to have years of failure.",

    "173": "No man is a failure who is enjoying life.",
    "174": "Discipline is based on pride, on meticulous attention to details, and on mutual respect and confidence. Discipline must be a habit so ingrained that it is stronger than the excitement of the goal or the fear of failure.",

    "176": "Failure and its accompanying misery is for the artist his most vital source of creative energy.",
    "177": "If you're the type of person who has to fulfill your dreams, you've gotta be resourceful to make sure you can do it. I came out to California when I was 21, thinking my New York credentials would take me all the way. I came back home a year later all dejected and a failure.",
    "178": "All I can do will only ever be a faint image of what I see and my success will always be less than my failure or perhaps equal to the failure.",
    "179": "We need to accept that we won't always make the right decisions, that we'll screw up royally sometimes - understanding that failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success.",

    "182": "One of the most basic factors in sports is that winning becomes a habit, and losing is the same way. When failure starts to feel normal in your life or your work or even your darkest vices, you won't have to go looking for trouble, because trouble will find you. Count on it.",

    "189": "Burnout is grist to the mill. I write every day, for most of the day, so it's just about turning into metaphor whatever's going on in my life, in the world, and in my head. Every nightmare, every moment of grief or joy or failure, is a moment I can convert into cash via words.",

    "193": "The fact that The Bridge contains folk lore and other material suitable to the epic form need not therefore prove its failure as a long lyric poem, with interrelated sections.",
    "194": "He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being.",
    "195": "I'm fascinated by failure, and I'm fascinated by finality. Shakespeare's historical plays are more universal than his comedies because they relate to the finality of life. Without finality, life would not be beautiful.",

We didn't know that the Soviets were moving 400,000 or 500,000 troops. We missed it.",
    "328": "Having written both comedy and drama, comedy's harder because the fear of failure's so much stronger. When you write a scene and you see it cut together, and it doesn't make you laugh, it hurts in a way that failed drama doesn't. Failed drama, it's all, 'That's not that compelling,' but failed comedy just lays there.",

    "628": "As an entrepreneur, I've come across countless articles and quotes proudly telling me that I should accept failure, smile, and keep my head up.
